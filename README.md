# Bravo-Tech-Blog

## Description
  This application is a CMS-style blog site where developers in the tech world can publish articles, blog posts, and any thoughts and opinions. To start, users create a username, email and password to create an account. Navigation to the homepage presents the user with existing blog posts. Clicking on either the title of the blog post or the comments takes the user to the blog post that includes the post title, creator's username, date the post was created as well as an option to leave a comment. If a comment is entered and saved then the post is updated to display the comment, the comment creator's name and the date it was created. The dashboard option in the navigation takes the user to any blog posts the user has created and the option to add a new blog post. When the user chooses to edit any of their existing blog posts, they are able to delete or update their post. The logout option allows the user to sign out. If the user is inactive for more than a minute, it will automatically sign the user out of the site.
